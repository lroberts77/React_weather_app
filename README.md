# React Weather App

#### Technologies: React, JavaScript, CSS, openweather API

## Project direction
I decided to make a few projects to help me learn and practice React. I used various online learning materials to help me make this simple app. I wanted to keep it simple and add in an API fetch so that I could understand and learn as I progressed.

## Learning goals
* API fetch
* Setting state with API response
* form event data handling
* Dynamic background 
* CSS
* React import and export

## Installation
To clone the repo

In the terminal
$ git clone git@github.com:lroberts77/React_weather_app.git
$ cd React_weather_app
$ npm install

## Usage
Open a terminal in your text editor while in the root of the React_weather_app folder

In the terminal
$ npm start

Then open a internet explorer and type in localhost:3000 in the url bar. Once the page has loaded type any country in the search bar to see the weather and the temperature. I also added a bit of logic that changes the background picture depending on whether the temperature is above or below 15Â°.


## Next steps...
* Add more detailed weather description
* Add feels like temperature
* Add wind speed
